# Part Of Speech Tagger

Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is one of the most important addressed areas in the natural language processing (NLP). There are effective POS taggers for many languages. We tried to develop a POS tagger for the Arabic language, specifically for the modern standard Arabic (MSA), because itâ€™s the language used in the formal textbooks and news. 
The objective of our solution is to firstly create a tokenizer that splits any file you choose into a list of words with removing any punctuations and numbers from the list. And secondly create a POS tagger which takes the list of words from tokenizer and then tag each word with its appropriate POS(verb, noun, particle) based on a combination of rules. Finally we created a golden corpus from a sample of the actual corpus folder to test our algorithm and see how accurate and precise with its tagging.
